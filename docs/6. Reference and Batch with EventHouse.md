# Reference and Batch with EventHouse 

*This exercise should take no more than 10 minutes*

Whilst EventHouse is considered a real-time database it is also commonly used to deliver and query batch data. Data can be ingested in many ways including custom command line tools and an API. By far the most common way is using Data Pipelines. This exercise will illustrate how to use Data Pipelines to load data on a schedule or as a one-off event.
