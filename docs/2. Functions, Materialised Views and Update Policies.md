# Functions, Materialized Views and Update Policies

Kusto has lots of different inbuilt capabilities which allow you to make it behave like a relational data source. This is from a compute perspective, Kusto isn't hampered with referential integrity and doesn't subscribed to normal form in the same way as SQL Server. However, functions are akin to user defined functions and materialized views allow views to be created which physically update data based on tables. Whilst we've looked at various ways to ingest and process data using pipelines, Kusto offers another in the use of update policies which we'll look at too.

This exercise should take **30 minutes** to read through.

## Working with Functions 

For now we're going to run a query which will list the fastest planes and calculate the fastest acceleration by call sign if there is multiple data per call signs.

Use the following KQL which will give us the top 100 fastest planes.

```kql
FlightDataRaw
| project AirplanCallSign = callsign, 
          CountryOfOrigin = origin_country, 
          Velocity = tolong(velocity)
| order by Velocity
| limit 100
```

Looking at the output it's likely that there are some anomalies in the velocity. As such we'll build another query to get the list of flight anomalies over a certain value.

| Call Sign | Country of Origin       | Velocity |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------|
| DEGCR     | Germany                | 2101     |
| AHY182    | Azerbaijan             | 1899     |
| AHY182    | Azerbaijan             | 754      |
| SVR783    | Russian Federation     | 743      |
| SBI2505   | Russian Federation     | 359      |
| DAL388    | United States          | 346      |
| CAL006    | Taiwan                 | 343      |
| CAL006    | Taiwan                 | 343      |
| CPA838    | China                  | 338      |

We can also build in a new calculation to get miles per hour as the velocity is in m/s.

```kql
FlightDataRaw
| project AirplanCallSign = callsign, 
          CountryOfOrigin = origin_country, 
          Velocity = round((tolong(velocity) * 3.6) / 1.6, 0)
| where Velocity < 800
| order by Velocity
| limit 100
```

we're going to create a new function now which we can call to get the top 100 velocities of all the aircraft.

We can start by using the let keyword:

```kql
let GetFlightData = () {
    FlightDataRaw
    | project 
        AirplanCallSign = callsign, 
        CountryOfOrigin = origin_country, 
        Velocity = round((tolong(velocity) * 3.6) / 1.6, 0)
    | where Velocity < 800
    | order by Velocity
    | limit 100
};

GetFlightData()
```

We can also parameterise this so that hard coded values like velocities and limits can be passed in.

```kql
let GetFlightData = (maxVelocity: long = 800, resultLimit: int = 100) {
    FlightDataRaw
    | project 
        AirplanCallSign = callsign, 
        CountryOfOrigin = origin_country, 
        Velocity = round((tolong(velocity) * 3.6) / 1.6, 0)
    | where Velocity < maxVelocity
    | order by Velocity
    | limit resultLimit
};

GetFlightData()

GetFlightData(600, 50)
```

You should highlight the query to execute it in the query pane along with the let in one go otherwise you'll get an error if you just highlight the let as it won't know what to execute as let is executed lazily.

Now the function will be created, we can use it later in our dashboard.

```kql
.create-or-alter function 
with (docstring = "Gets flight data with velocity filtering", folder = "Functions") 
GetFlightData(maxVelocity: long = 800, resultLimit: int = 100)
{
    FlightDataRaw
    | project 
        AirplanCallSign = callsign, 
        CountryOfOrigin = origin_country, 
        Velocity = round((tolong(velocity) * 3.6) / 1.6, 0),
        Latitude = latitude,
        Longitude = longitude
    | where Velocity < maxVelocity
    | order by Velocity
    | limit resultLimit
}
```

We can check the function by calling directly anytime **GetFlightData()**.

We're going to write a second function now which will check some of the geolocation capabilities in Kusto and allow us to see whether a flight that has left the USA is still in the USA so could be an internal flight.

```kql
let us_polygon = dynamic({
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [[
        [-125.0, 24.396308], 
        [-125.0, 49.384358], 
        [-66.93457, 49.384358], 
        [-66.93457, 24.396308], 
        [-125.0, 24.396308]
    ]]
});
GetFlightData(maxVelocity=800, resultLimit=100)
| where isnotempty(Latitude) and isnotempty(Longitude)
//| extend Location = pack_array(Longitude, Latitude)
| extend IsOverUS = geo_point_in_polygon(todouble(Longitude), todouble(Latitude), us_polygon)
| project AirplanCallSign, CountryOfOrigin, Latitude, Longitude, Velocity, IsOverUS
| extend PossibleInternalFlight = iif(IsOverUS and CountryOfOrigin == "United States", true, false)
| where PossibleInternalFlight == true
```

**Challenge**: Build a function for the above query called IsInternalFlight passing in the maxVelocity, resultLimit and the Country or Origin - keep the defaults.

## Using Materialized Views

We're going to run another query now which will be used to get the top 70 planes that have not sent their callsign and position recently

```kql
FlightDataRaw
| where isnotnull(last_contact)
| project 
    AirplanCallSign = callsign, 
    CountryOfOrigin = origin_country, 
    TimePosition = iff(isnotnull(time_position), unixtime_seconds_todatetime(time_position), datetime(null)),
    LastContact = unixtime_seconds_todatetime(last_contact),
    MinutesSinceLastContact = round(datetime_diff('minute', now(), unixtime_seconds_todatetime(last_contact)), 2)
| order by MinutesSinceLastContact desc 
| limit 70
```

Given this table could take some time to calculate we'll be calculating it in the background with a materialised view.

```kql
.create materialized-view with 
(
    docstring = "Materialized view of flight data with time position and minutes since last contact",
    folder = "FlightData"
) FlightDataWithTimestamps on table DataRaw
{
    FlightDataRaw
    | project 
        AirplanCallSign = callsign, 
        CountryOfOrigin = origin_country, 
        TimePosition = iff(isnotnull(time_position), unixtime_seconds_todatetime(time_position), datetime(null)),
        LastContact = unixtime_seconds_todatetime(last_contact),
        MinutesSinceLastContact = round(datetime_diff('minute', now(), unixtime_seconds_todatetime(last_contact)), 2)
    | summarize 
        LastTimePosition = max(TimePosition),
        LastContact = max(LastContact),
        ContactCount = count()
    by AirplanCallSign, CountryOfOrigin, MinutesSinceLastContact
}
```

In order to run this every 30 seconds we need to set an appropriate policy.

```kql
.alter-merge materialized-view FlightDataWithTimestamps policy merge ``
{
    "IsEnabled": true,
    "SourceTable": "FlightDataRaw",
    "RefreshInterval": "00:00:30"
}
``
```

Place 3 backticks in this instead of . Avoided a rendering error!

To test this run the following query:

```kql
FlightDataWithTimestamps
| where MinutesSinceLastContact > 60
| count
```

**Challenge**: Create a materialized view which can be used to change the baro_altitude and geo_altitude which are listed in meters to feet. Run a query to show any aircraft that are under 2000 feet. For a special addition check to see whether they are not in their country of origin and create a variable IsLanding.

## Running update policies 

Update policies provide a convenient way to trigger an update to a new table. We called our incoming table FlightDataRaw so that we could allow an update policy which will trigger a query and insert into a new table.

We'll create a new table with the following KQL:

```kql
.create table FlightsInUSA (
    AirplanCallSign: string,
    CountryOfOrigin: string,
    Latitude: real,
    Longitude: real,
    Velocity: real,
    IsOverUS: bool,
    PossibleInternalFlight: bool
)
```

In order to run the update policy we can use the following KQL:

```kql
.alter-merge table FlightsInUSA policy update ``[{
    "IsEnabled": true,
    "Source": "DataRaw",
    "Query": "let us_polygon = dynamic({ \"type\": \"Polygon\", \"coordinates\": [[ [-125.0, 24.396308], [-125.0, 49.384358], [-66.93457, 49.384358], [-66.93457, 24.396308], [-125.0, 24.396308] ]] }); GetFlightData(maxVelocity=800, resultLimit=100) | where isnotempty(Latitude) and isnotempty(Longitude) | extend IsOverUS = geo_point_in_polygon(todouble(Longitude), todouble(Latitude), us_polygon) | project AirplanCallSign, CountryOfOrigin, toreal(Latitude), toreal(Longitude), toreal(Velocity), IsOverUS | extend PossibleInternalFlight = iif(IsOverUS and CountryOfOrigin == \"United States\", true, false) | where PossibleInternalFlight == true",
    "IsTransactional": false
}]``
```

In order to test this check to see whether there are 5 rows in place in the new table!

```kql
FlightsInUSA
| limit 5
```

In the next exercise we'll be looking at how to build a dashboard in EventHouse.
