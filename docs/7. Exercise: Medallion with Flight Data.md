# Final exercise: pulling everything together 

*This exercise should take no more than 30 minutes*

In this exercise you'll use the Flight data and create a medallion pipeline simulation using update policies in EventHouse.

In order to do this you'll need to do the following:

- Build a Dimension *materialized view* called DimOriginCountry, each country should have a unique key
- Build a Dimension *materialized view* called DimCallSign with each CallSign of each aircraft 
- Build a Fact Table called FactPosition containing the aircraft's position 
- Build a DimDate column
- Build a Dashboard with a Map showing three parameters, OriginCountry, CallSign and Date showing the aircraft with it's latest positions on the map
